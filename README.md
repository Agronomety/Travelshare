# Travelshare

Travelshare is a web service built with C# using the .NET framework, complemented by JavaScript on the frontend. It allows users to explore travel blogs, share their own travel experiences, and engage with others by liking and commenting on posts.

## Features
- **Browse Travel Blogs**: Discover travel experiences shared by other users.
- **User Registration and Login**: Create an account to share your own stories.
- **Engagement**: Like and comment on posts to interact with the community.

## Getting Started
Travelshare is hosted on [Render.com](https://render.com) and may require a cold start due to the free-tier hosting limitations. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Open the backend server URL: [https://travelshare-zk2c.onrender.com](https://travelshare-zk2c.onrender.com).  
   Allow up to 1 minute for the server to initialize if it is inactive.
2. Once the server is running, visit the main website: [https://thetravelshareexperience.onrender.com](https://thetravelshareexperience.onrender.com).  
   The initial page load may take a few seconds due to the hosting environment.

After the initial load, you can fully explore and use all the features of Travelshare.

## Technologies Used
