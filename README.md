# To use.
Travelshare is on https://thetravelshareexperience.onrender.com. Since this is on the free tier on Render.com your first time loading the page might take a couple of seconds due to it being asleep after 15 min of inactivity. 
Since the server is deployed there as well you might also want to open up https://travelshare-zk2c.onrender.com and close it to coldstart the server which needs to load for up to 1 min. 
After that you will be able to use all the functions on the website.
